### Changing SPI speed ###

Master clock is 132 MHZ; CPU is 396 MHZ (3x MCK); crystal is 18.432 MHZ (MCK/7.16?).

SPI clock is MCK divided by 8 bit value stored in the SCBR field, which is part of the SPI_CSR0-SPI_CSR3 registers.

132/9 = 14.67 MHz, appears to be what is produced by 15 * 1000 * 1000 in driver code.

Minimum speed is 132/255 = 518 kHz.
