This information should be on the internet, but it is not.

When setting up an Exchange account with Outlook at Tufts, use this format:

    username: tufts\BSTAFF01
    password: **************

The `BSTAFF01` part should be your Tufts username, AKA your UTLN.

May nobody else eveer need to traverse the hell I have just traversed.
