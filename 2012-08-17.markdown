### Testing SPI ###

Sends data out MOSI and pulses clock at ~15 MHz, but chip select stays low. Expect SS0 on PB3, AKA M16. (Checked SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3.)

```bash
echo "Aaron Burr" > /dev/spidev1.0
```

Testing with an Arduino SPI slave using code from http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=10892

With the slave code modified to send each character out the serial port immediately, rather than waiting for a newline character, it almost works. Characters are returned, but they're not the right ones. Probably the Rascal max speed of ~15 MHz is too fast for the Arduino. The Arduino can only transmit at 4 MHz. Receive speed might be even slower.
