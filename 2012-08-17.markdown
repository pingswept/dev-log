### Testing SPI ###

Sends data out MOSI and pulses clock at ~15 MHz, but chip select stays low. Expect SS0 on PB3, AKA M16. (Checked SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3.)

```bash
echo "Aaron Burr" > /dev/spidev1.0
```

Testing with an Arduino SPI slave using code from http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=10892

With the slave code modified to send each character out the serial port immediately, rather than waiting for a newline character, it almost works. Characters are returned, but they're not the right ones. Probably the Rascal max speed of ~15 MHz is too fast for the Arduino. The Arduino can only transmit at 4 MHz. Receive speed might be even slower.

Tried to change driver to slower max speed. Seemed to compile fine.

```bash
.max_speed_hz   = 15 * 1000 * 10,
```

But, error in dmesg when driver was loaded.

```bash
atmel_spi atmel_spi.1: Atmel SPI Controller at 0xfffcc000 (irq 13)
atmel_spi atmel_spi.1: can't setup spi1.0, status -22
atmel_spi atmel_spi.1: can't setup spi1.1, status -22
atmel_spi atmel_spi.1: can't setup spi1.2, status -22
```

Also, could be problem with 5 V Arduino not registering 3.3 V signals.

(Later discovered it worked fine, but the chip select started way early and ended way late, so it appeared to be eternally low at first glance.)
